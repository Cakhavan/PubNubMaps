# PubNubMaps
This is a simple Geotracking app that renders multiple users on a map view such as IOS or Google Maps. Users will be able to toggle their location permissions as well as click a button to zoom the map on their location. And of course it wouldn’t be PubNub if we didn’t include PubNub Presence to track how many users are currently online in the app.
